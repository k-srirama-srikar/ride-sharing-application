# Ride Sharing Application

As a part of the DS3020 (Database Syatems) course, we've developed a Ride Sharing Application!

To be more specific, we properly implemented it as a backend API and the project is majorly focussed on the backend implementaion as it was made specifically for the course.

### üìù About The Project

As said above this is a ride sharing application wherein you can request a ride (like any other typical platform to book rides), but with a lil twist! You can share your rides with other passengers! Well, at least that was the idea we began with and have kind of implemented it in a sense, despite the ride sharing algorithm not being so complicated (well, making it better is a story for another day)
